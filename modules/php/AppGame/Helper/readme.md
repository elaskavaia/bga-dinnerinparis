# Helper

~~A helper is used to verify or realize an action or a set of actions in the current context. It may and may be not about entities. The helper have to be instantiated for
each usage as it is attached to the close context, and it could own context properties.~~

Helpers are similar to service, but they are specific to context, we prefer to use a job namespaces for these, see AppGame\Game.
